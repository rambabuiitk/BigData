In online advertising, a valuable technology is "targeting". Targeting allows advertisers to 
deliver advertising content specific to certain user attributes such as geographic location,
age or which websites the user has visited. One method of storing these user attributes is 
through segments.  A segment is an identifier (in our case, a number) to a specific
attribute. For example, the segment 1 could be used to identify a user who is male while the
segment 2 could be used to identify users who are female.

------[ Specification

The program will take a single argument, a file containing a list of campaigns.
This file will consist of several rows, each with a variable number of columns.
The first column is the unique identifier of a campaign (a single word). The
columns after the first are the segments that the campaign is targeting.
Duplicate columns and/or rows are valid and to be ignored.

Once the program has loaded the data file, it will be ready to accept input
from users. Lines of data will be read from standard input where each line
consists of a list of segments some user is associated with. It is not
guaranteed that a segment a user belongs to has any campaigns associated with
it. Given this list of segments, a campaign containing the largest set of
common segments is to be selected. Once a campaign has been selected, the
name of the campaign is to be printed on a single line. If no eligible
campaign is found, "no campaign" is to be printed on a single line.

    Example data file (example_data.txt):
    ,----------------------------------------,
    | campaign_a 3 4 10 2                    |
    | campaign_b 9 14 15 21 3                |
    | campaign_c 12 1024 200 3 9 4           |
    '----------------------------------------'


    Example usage for the above data file:
    ,----------------------------------------,
    | shell$ ./campaign example_data.txt     |
    | 3 4 5 10 2 200                         |<- 1 input
    | campaign_a                             |-> 1 output
    | 3                                      |<- 2 input
    | campaign_a                             |-> 2 output
    | 3                                      |<- 3 input
    | campaign_c                             |-> 3 output
    | 4 10 15                                |<- 4 input
    | campaign_a                             |-> 4 output
    | 1024 15 200 21 9 14 15                 |<- 5 input
    | campaign_c                             |-> 5 output
    | 9000 29833 65000                       |<- 6 input
    | no campaign                            |-> 6 output
    '----------------------------------------'

In the first line of input, the user belonged to one segment campaign_b
was targeting, four segments that campaign_a was targeting and three
segments that campaign_b was targeting. campaign_a was selected since
it was targeting the largest number of segments associated with the user.
In the second line of input, the user belonged to one segment in each
campaign. Due to this, any of the campaigns are eligible for selection.
In the fourth line of input, the user belongs to two segments in
campaign_a and one segment in campaign_b. Since the user belonged to
more segments from campaign_a, campaign_a was selected. In the fifth
line of input, the user belongs to three segments that campaign_c is
targeting and two segments that campaign_b was targeting. Since the
user belonged to more segments from campaign_c, campaign_c was selected.
In the sixth line of input, no campaign targeted any of the segments
the user was associated with, so "no campaign" was provided as output.

------[ Additional Information

There are only 65536 segments from 0 to 65535. This application will
process many users a second, so it is important that it is fast. The
input and the campaign list we will be using are in the "examples"
directory (input.txt and campaign.txt respectively).

------[ Extra Credit

How would you decrease the probability of starving a specific campaign?
For example, let us say that campaign_a and campaign_b were to target
the same segments. How would you distribute your selection of the campaigns?

------[ Submission Instructions

Please provide a .tar.gz file of an archive containing a directory that is
named in the following format: <first letter of first name><last name>-1.
The resulting .tar.gz file would then be called
<first letter of first name><last name>-1.tar.gz. For example, if "John Doe"
was your name then your program would be contained in a directory "jdoe-1"
and archived to "jdoe-1.tar.gz". On my system, I would create "jdoe-1.tar.gz"
with: "tar cvfz jdoe-1.tar.gz jdoe-1". An example Makefile and campaign.c is provided
in the template directory. Please use the Makefile provided in this directory.

    Example
    ,----------------------------------------------------------,
    | shell$ ls -l jdoe-1                                      |
    | total 0                                                  |

    | -rw-r--r-- 1 developer users 0 Jan 11 12:55 campaign.c   |
    | shell$ tar cvfz jdoe-1.tar.gz jdoe-1                     |
    | jdoe-1/                                                  |

    | shell$ file jdoe-1.tar.gz                                |
